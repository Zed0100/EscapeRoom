# EscapeRoom

# Made by Arturo Gonzalez and Zed Chen. Group Section 6 #9.

# Our first idea was a timer, but we realized that attempts would work better for a game we have to escape the room.

# Escape the room! To escape, click on objects within the picture and find clues to escape. Once you find all four clues, enter them in the correct order on the panel and win the game. You will find two screens, one panel to insert numbers as you find clues and the main panel to click on objects to uncover clues.

# Be wary when solving the puzzles, some clues are scrambled.

# This game does not need any additional libraries installed to function. All libraries used are defaults from python.
